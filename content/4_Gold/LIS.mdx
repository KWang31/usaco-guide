<!-- ### Longest Increasing Subsequence -->

<!-- Some of the problems in this section don't initially look like Longest Increasing Subsequence, but it ends up being the solution. <Asterisk> This can happen a lot, which is why it's a good idea to not focus on one topic unless you have a full solution.</Asterisk> -->
